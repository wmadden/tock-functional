# Tock

This is a toy project to try out functional programming in React.

## Goals

1) Functional instead of imperative
  - Components built using pure functions (i.e. only input -> output)
2) Try out Redux
3) Try out React-Router
4) Try out react-mdl - Google's Material Design Lite wrapped in React
